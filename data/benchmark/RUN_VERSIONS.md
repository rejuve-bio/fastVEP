# Benchmark run versions

Each row of the `output_v*/` directories represents one end-to-end run
of the ClinVar 2-star+ benchmark on the same 673,660-variant truth set.
Successive runs differ only in (a) which supplementary annotation
databases were loaded into `--sa-dir` and (b) which classifier / output
bugs had been fixed.

(PhyloP and SpliceAI are distilled from gnomAD v4 INFO fields
`phylop` and `spliceai_ds_max` rather than re-downloaded; the gnomAD
v4 sites VCF already includes them. ClinGen GDV substitutes for
OMIM `genemap2.txt` per ClinGen SVI / Abou Tayoun 2018 — same `.oga`
schema, `omim` json_key, but with a multi-curator scored rubric and
explicit Definitive/Strong/Moderate filtering.)

v3 was a partial run (PhyloP+SpliceAI loaded but bugs still latent);
its results are functionally indistinguishable from v2 and were
overwritten before being preserved.

## Driver of each lift

- **+39 pp LB recall, +25 pp B recall** (v1 → v5): BP7 went from **0**
  → **81,706 fires** once PhyloP+SpliceAI were loaded *and* both
  wiring bugs were fixed. (Walker 2023: BP7 needs synonymous + low
  SpliceAI + low PhyloP.)
- **+48 pp Pathogenic recall, +31 pp LP recall** (v5 → v6): the
  classifier's PM2 evaluator previously refused to fire when
  `input.gnomad` was `None` (no gnomAD record at the variant). For
  ~78 % of the truth's pathogenic class — most rare disease variants
  aren't in gnomAD — that meant PM2 NotEvaluated, so PVS1 had no
  partner criterion and the PVS+≥1 PP (SVI Sept 2020) → LP rule
  couldn't trigger. Default config flag
  `pm2_absent_when_no_record = true` interprets a missing record as
  "absent from gnomAD" per ClinGen SVI v1.0. PM2_Supporting fires
  jumped from ~12K → 340K, unlocking the LP rule for ~50K Pathogenic
  variants. PVS1 also nearly doubled (27K → 50K P+LP) because
  BP4-splice is no longer (incorrectly) firing on frameshift / null
  variants — Walker 2023 explicitly scopes BP4-splice to
  splice-territory consequences.
- **VUS recall slight drop (-5 pp)**: by design — when more benign
  evidence fires, some variants previously called VUS now correctly
  drop to LB / B (which doesn't match a VUS truth). Same-direction
  rate still rises because the P/LP/B/LB gains far outweigh the VUS
  loss.
- **+15,199 Benign exact-match calls** (v6 → v7): two ClinGen-SVI BS-tier
  fixes from a deep classifier audit. **(1)** BS1 was reading cohort
  `all_af` instead of `max_pop_af` — a 5%-AF EAS variant could slip
  under a 1% BS1 threshold whenever the global cohort diluted it.
  ClinGen SVI applies BS1 against the max-pop AF (mirroring BA1).
  Effect: BS1 fires went **6.4× higher** (4,104 → 26,291). Many LB
  calls in v6 promote to B in v7 once BS1+BP fires. **(2)** BS2 was
  firing for AD genes on any single het in gnomAD (`AF > 0 && AN >
  10000`) — a singleton novel allele in a 100K cohort isn't
  "observed in healthy adult" per Richards 2015. Tightened to AC ≥ 5
  by default (`bs2_ad_min_ac`). False-positive BS2 fires on
  Pathogenic ClinVar variants cut by **52%** (809 → 389). Net
  opposite-direction rate dropped from 0.05% to 0.0%.

## Where to find each version

- v1 baseline: `output_v1/concordance_matrix.csv` +
  `output_v1/README.md` (raw outputs were overwritten; matrix
  reconstructed from documentation)
- v7 current: `output_v7/` (full outputs + figures + raw VCF.gz)
